          Studying Things in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am glad that you have decided to come study with me! Or are you just
          here to see what is going on? Either way I am glad you are here.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this page I am going to share my thoughts that I have had while
          studying. The studying topics can come from the scriptures, conference
          talks, music, or even books. Those books can be
          <em>Temple Prep, Saints, or Preach my Gospel</em>. It just depends on
          what I am reading/studying that day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either way you are welcome to read and even tell me your thoughts. I
          have a comment box below, and until I learn how to make it so that
          your comments are seen as you publish them. You will just be sending
          me an email and I will add what you told me. Unless you don't want
          anyone to read it but me then just say so.

            AKA Temple Prep
          </h4>
          <p>
            I have been preparing to enter the temple, and I am so excited but
            also nervous. The way I have been preparing to go is by going to
            temple prep and reading
            <em>Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple.</em> This is a booklet that
            is used in temple prep. It is a booklet adapted from the book
            <em>The Holy Temple,</em> by Boyd Kay Packer.<br />
            These are things that stood out to me, and that I had impressions
            on.
          </p>
          <h5><em>Come to the Temple</em></h5>
          <p class="quote">
            “In the Church we build buildings pf many kinds. In them we worship,
            we teach, we find recreation, we organize. We can organize stakes
            and wards, and missions and quorums and Relief Societies in these
            buildings or even in rented halls. But, when
            <mark
              >we organize families according to the order that the Lord has
              revealed, we organize them in the temples.</mark
            >
            Temple marriage, that sealing ordnance, is a crowning blessing, that
            you may claim in the holy temple.” (Page 1:Paragraph 2)
          </p>
          <p>
            I think it is neat that they word this as organizing the family. I
            never thought of it that way, and it is true. The Lord organizes
            everything, even if you don’t realize it. When I think about it, I
            realized that the Lord has organized a lot of things. The Nephites,
            the people of Babylon, and the twelve tribes of Israel, even the
            different age groups that you have when going to church. What else
            can you think of that the Lord has organized?
          </p>
          <h5><em>"These Things are Sacred"</em></h5>
          <p class="quote">
            “Those who have been to the temple have been taught an ideal:<mark>
              Someday every living soul and every soul who has ever lived shall
              have the opportunity to hear the gospel and to accept or reject
              what the temple offers. If this opportunity is rejected, the
              rejection must be I the part of the individual.</mark
            >”
          </p>

          <p>
            The only one who can say no to the gospel is themselves. The Lord
            and Jesus are wiling to let anyone accept and come into the kingdom
            of God. If they are willing to accept the truths that they are
            shown. If they are not that is on them, and we have no room to
            judge.
